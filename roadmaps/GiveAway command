    web integration for displayable counters and winners
        smooth ui with easy to define boundaries for...
            giveaway prize
            length of giveaway


giveaway command preweb final state would need features like:
    ☒ database infrastructure
        ☒ setup of database
            ☒ base datastructures for command

    working command for full setup
        ☒ locked for mods/broadcasters/editors or possible trustlist only   [locked for broadcaster for now]
        possible versions like:
            !giveaway {time} {prize}    [semi solved doesnt state time and price]
            !gaway {time} {price}   [semi solved doesnt state time and price]
                ☒ end of time print winner    [prints winner when end command called]

                ***changed this to be 1/1 command for start stop and added join command***

    ☒ working command for joining   [more to come]
        possible versions like:
            ☒ !join
            !giveaway



    usage of time/timer [needed for webstate and potential in preweb to disable joincommand at x time]
        check at which time the giveaway will end
